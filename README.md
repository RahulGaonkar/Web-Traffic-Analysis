Web Traffic Analysis across the City of Santa Monica's web presence
## About
Performed web traffic analysis across the City of Santa Monica's web presence. Web traffic analysis involved time series forecasting of web page views. The analysis will help the website owner to understand the traffic they are getting on the websites and will help them to take decisions regarding advertisements, website design, customer acquisition, server maintenance, etc.

We also analyzed the effect of the confounding variables (avg page load time, avg time on page, bounces) on the page views of the web pages.
